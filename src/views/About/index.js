          <p>
            I am a 23 years old self-taught programmer, based in London. I work
            for Revolut in FinCrime department. I aim to deliver good quality
            code and well-designed solutions. I am the kind of person that never
            settles and keeps working hard on improvements.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am most proficient in Python, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by this
            language, ever since I started coding. Sometimes I play around with
            React and other related web technologies. Back in the day, I used to
            contribute to Stack Overflow by answering questions related to my
            interests such as web scraping.
          </p>
          <p>
            I really enjoy working from the office, but nowadays, I am looking
            for remote opportunities, that would let me travel and see more
            beautiful places in the world. Currently, I am staying on Tenerife
            and really enjoy it so far.
