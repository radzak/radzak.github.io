          <p>
            I&apos;m 21 years old self-taught programmer based in Poland. My
            main field of expertise is Python, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by this
            language, ever since I started coding.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, not long time ago I decided to broaden my horizons and
            expand my knowledge by learning React and other related web
            technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time I like to contribute to Stack Overflow by answering
            questions related to my interests such as web scraping.
